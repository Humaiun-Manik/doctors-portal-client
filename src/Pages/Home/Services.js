              Gum disease can be caused by a number of factors including poor oral hygiene, loss of teeth as
              well as some health related factors such as stress, diabetes and pregnancy. The best way to
              prevent gum disease is with a comprehensive oral regime of brushing, flossing and rinsing. This
              will keep your mouth healthy between visits to our practice where professional cleaning and
              close check-ups are completed to prevent gum disease from occurring.
